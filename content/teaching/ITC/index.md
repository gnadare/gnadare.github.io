title: Introduction to Theory of Computation, Summer 2024
summary: 'This class deals with fundamental questions: what is computable, 
what is not? What is provable and what not? What is computable 
with feasible effort. The concrete example ‘can RSA be broken with 
reasonable computation time?’ shows, that such fundamental 
questions have enormous practical importance.'

Although we are dealing with a very wide range of questions for the 
better half of the lecture we are forced to rely on only two proof 
techniques: diagonalization and simulation theorems between 
computational models. We simply do not have other techniques 
which work (for now, but that is the case since many decades).

Planned course Content by weeks:

1) Regular expressions, finite automata and 
nondeterminism.
2) Context free languages and pushdown automata.
3) Context sensitive languages, type-0 
languages and Turing machines.
4) Recursive functions, computability and 
decidability.
5) Undecidable problems and the recursion 
theorem.
6) Proof Systems.
7) Goedel’s incompleteness theorems.
8) Turing machine complexity classes.
9) Complexity hierarchies.
10) Speed up and Gap theorem.
11) NP completeness.
12) More about complete problems.
13) Time versus space.
14) Determinism versus nondeterminism.
15) Applications of Kolmogorov complexit.

During these lectires, we will cover fundamental results present in a more conventional 
treatment of the subject as well. In particular we will treat:

<ul>
<li> The Recursion Theorem.</li>
<li> The two fundamental incompleteness theorems 
of Goedel.</li>
<li> The speed up and gap theorems of Manuel Blum
and Allan Borodin.</li>
<li> Two fundamental separation theorems between the classic 
complexity classes of complexity theory.</li>
<li> Applications of Kolmogorov complexity.</li>
</ul>
