summary: A talk at an online workshop that brings together researchers and students with backgrounds in either C*-algebraic KK-theory or homotopy theory to learn about the growing interactions between the two fields. 

abstract: 'We briefly describe the general machinery for deriving Universal Coefficient Theorems in different categories of Kasparov`s KK-theory. We go on to consider the KK-category of finite group actions that are equivalent to one on a Type I C*-algebra; we explain how after localising at the group order, we can specialize to the appropriate Universal Coefficient Theorem. The talk follows a joint work with Ralf Meyer.'
