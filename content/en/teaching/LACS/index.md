title: Linear Algebra for Computer Science
summary: 'Goals of this class are to develop mathematical understanding of basic concepts and techniques from linear algebra that will be required in later courses. These include studying linear systems of equations, understanding fundamental properties of matrices, comprehending notions of a vector, a vector space and linear transformation as well as understanding basics of complex numbers.'

Linear Algebra is an important Mathematics course of a bachelor educational program of Computer Science. The course is to lay a foundation for future study of subjects like computer graphics, machine learning and quantum computing. This course serves as a cornerstone for applications; we will not only to evaluate studentsâ€™ theoretical knowledge, but also assess their skills for modelling practical problems and finding solutions to them.

Rough course content:

- Linear systems, existence of solutions.
-	Basic concepts of vectors, vector spaces, span, basis, linear independence, linear transformations.
-	Fundamentals of complex numbers.
-	Fundamental properties of matrices: row echelon form, determinants, transpose and inverse matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, similarity, diagonalization, representation of linear transformations.
-	Applications of linear algebra.

Literature used:

- <i>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</i> by Gilbert Strang, 2006.
- <i>Introduction to Linear Algebra</i> by Gilbert Strang, 2009.
- <i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i> by Sheldon Axler, 2015.
- <i>Undergraduate Algebra</i> by Serge Lang, 2000.
- <i>Linear Algebra with Applications</i> by Otto Bretscher, 2013.
