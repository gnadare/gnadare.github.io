   This research explores the application of statistical methods and functions in Python, using Georgian school data as a real-world example. The focus lies on analyzing school utility bills, teacher salaries, and infrastructure conditions to uncover trends, optimize resources, and propose improvements.

   Key objectives include:

   - Understanding statistical methodologies such as regression, distribution, deviation, and others.
   - Implementing these methods in Python to solve practical problems.
   - Providing a computational framework for students and professionals interested in data modeling and prediction.
